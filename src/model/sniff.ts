 * Which family a diagram belongs to, read off the top of its source.

 * tab would be absurd; the first word of a Mermaid file already says it.
 *
 * Deliberately forgiving and deliberately shallow: it reads a header, not a
 * diagram. Anything it does not recognise is nothing, and the tab simply goes
 * unlabelled rather than mislabelled.
