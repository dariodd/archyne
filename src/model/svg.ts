/**
 * Making an SVG from outside safe to put on the page.
 *
 * Archyne renders an icon by writing its markup into the DOM, which is fine
 * for the five it draws itself and for the bundled collections — they are
 * part of the build and cannot change under it. An icon a user imports is
 * different: it is a file from the internet, and the vendors' official packs
 * are exactly the files people will bring.
 *
 * The application's own Content-Security-Policy already refuses inline
 * scripts and every remote origin, so an SVG cannot easily do harm here. That
 * is not a reason to insert one unread. The policy is one layer, and a
 * diagram travels — the same file is opened in the desktop build, exported,
 * and pasted into whatever else reads Mermaid.
 *
 * So: an allow-list, not a list of things to strip. Anything unrecognised is
 * dropped rather than reasoned about, because the elements an icon needs are
 * few and well known, and the ones an attack needs are the ones nobody
 * thought to forbid.
