        // labels are *not* it: `common.sanitizeText` runs DOMPurify over every
        // label at every security level, "loose" included. The live difference
        // is `utils.formatUrl`, which only calls `sanitizeUrl` when the level
        // is not "loose". So under "loose" a `click x href "javascript:…"`
        // lands in the rendered anchor verbatim, and a shared link becomes
        // one-click script execution in the app's origin; under "strict" it
        // becomes about:blank. (The other difference, `click x call fn()`, is
        // inert here either way — binding it requires calling mermaid's
        // `bindFunctions`, which Archyne never does.)
        //
        // The CSP in index.html blocks javascript: URLs too, but that is a
        // meta tag a self-hoster can drop or a proxy can rewrite; this is the
        // layer that must hold on its own. Archyne uses no `click`
        // interactions, so strict costs nothing — tests/e2e-csp.mts pins both
        // halves of that claim.
