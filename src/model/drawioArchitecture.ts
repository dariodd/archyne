/**
 * Reading a draw.io **cloud architecture** drawing as `architecture-beta`.
 *
 * A VPC with subnets and a database is not a flowchart, and converting it to
 * one throws away the thing that makes it readable: the icons. Archyne has an
 * architecture editor with 16 600 vendor icons in it, so the shape *stencil*
 * a cell was drawn with — `mxgraph.aws4.rds`, `mxgraph.azure.sql_database` —
 * is worth far more than the rectangle it would otherwise become.
 *
 * The mapping is: a container becomes a `group`, everything else a `service`,
 * the stencil name becomes an icon, and the geometry decides which side of
 * each service a connection leaves from — `architecture-beta` has no
 * coordinates, so the relative positions are all the layout information that
 * can survive, and they survive as the anchors.
