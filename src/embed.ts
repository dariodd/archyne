/**
 * Embed mode: when loaded as `/?embed=1` inside an iframe, Archyne speaks a
 * small postMessage protocol with the host page (draw.io style):
 *
 *   host → archyne : { type: "load",   code }        load a mermaid diagram
 *                    { type: "getCode" }             ask for the current code
 *                    { type: "export", options? }    render an export
 *   archyne → host : { type: "ready" }               bridge is listening
 *                    { type: "loaded" }              load completed
 *                    { type: "change", code }        user edited (debounced)
 *                    { type: "code",   code }        reply to getCode
 *                    { type: "exported", format, dataUrl }
 *                    { type: "error",  message }
 *
 * The bridge is **default-deny**: the host must name itself with
 * `&origin=https://host.example` (comma-separate several). Diagram content is
 * only ever posted to an origin on that list. `origin=*` restores the old
 * answer-anyone behaviour and exists for local development only.
 *
 * The same protocol has a second transport. Inside a VS Code webview there is
 * no framing page to talk to — the extension host is on the other side of
 * `acquireVsCodeApi()` instead — so the messages are identical and only the
 * pipe differs. See `transport()` for why that one carries no allowlist.

 * top document, nothing may frame it, and the extension host that created it
 * is the only party on the other end of `acquireVsCodeApi`. There is no second
 * candidate to distinguish the first from, so there is nothing an allowlist
 * could exclude. What guards this pipe is the extension's `localResourceRoots`
 * and the webview CSP, not an origin string.
