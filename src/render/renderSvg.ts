/**
 * A diagram as a self-contained SVG string.
 *
 * This is the shape that makes Archyne importable. The editor can already be
 * embedded — an iframe and a `postMessage` protocol (`src/embed.ts`) — but an
 * application can only ever be *embedded*, and every Markdown preview that
 * draws diagrams bundles a library or shells out to a binary instead. Mermaid
 * is in all of them because it is those two things, not because of any plugin
 * protocol; none of those previews has a hook where another extension supplies
 * the renderer.
 *
 * So the output here is deliberately a *string* and not a DOM: geometry as real
 * `<rect>` and `<path>`, sizes worked out by `measureNode` rather than measured
 * afterwards by a browser, and the paint inlined as a `<style>` inside the
 * `<svg>` so the picture survives the page that made it. Cache it, put it in an
 * `<img>`, hand it to a PDF.
 *
 * ## What it does not do yet
 *
 * Every family Archyne edits: flowchart, state, ER, class, C4, architecture and
 * sequence. A kind it does not know is refused rather than half-drawn — see
 * `SUPPORTED`.
 *
 * Labels are real `<text>`, wrapped and positioned here from measured widths
 * and baselines. They were `<foreignObject>` first — Mermaid's own default —
 * until it became clear that the one route needing nobody's cooperation,
 * pre-rendering diagrams to `.svg` files beside a document, is exactly the route
 * where a foreignObject is not painted: `<img>`, GitHub, resvg, librsvg and
 * most PDF pipelines all drop it, leaving boxes with no words in them.
