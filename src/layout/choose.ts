/**
 * Which arrangement a drawing reads best in, worked out from the drawing.
 *
 * A flowchart can be banded, a relational model packed, a network settled as
 * if it were springs — and no single one of those is right for every file, so
 * "Arrange" had to be either a guess or a choice the reader has to make. The
 * reading of a file already knows the answer, though: a drawing reads best in
 * the arrangement that draws it least badly. Compare the arrangements
 * against each other, and *for this file* the choice makes itself.
 *
 * So `choose.ts` holds the one number that settles a comparison: a ranked
 * score of how badly an arrangement draws the file. The ranking is what the
 * drawing software has learned the hard way about what a reader recognises
 * first — and it is ranked rather than weighted because the parts have no
 * honest exchange rate, which is the same stand `Cost` in `labels.ts` takes.
 *
 *   - **`spill`** — a node sticking out of its own container. First because
 *     it is the worst and the rarest: every solver I tried at least once put
 *     a subnet's service on the subnet's frame, or the frame itself over its
 *     neighbour, and there is no reading where that looks intentional.
 *   - **overlap** — containers or boxes covering each other. The same kind
 *     of lie, without the boundary; a service sitting on a sibling reads as
 *     part of one box.
 *   - **coincident** — two connections drawn on top of each other. The
 *     reader sees one line and two arrowheads. Judged per pair of
 *     connections once, so a bundle of parallels from a shared port is not
 *     counted a dozen times.
 *   - **along a border** — a connection running flush with a container's
 *     edge, which reads as part of the frame.
 *   - **crossings** — connections genuinely travelling across each other,
 *     judged per pair of connections: one line crossing another in a bundle
 *     is still one crossing to the eye. The very thing an arrangement
 *     exists to reduce, so it carries weight — but a crossing is a break in
 *     a line, while the things above are lies about what the drawing is,
 *     and they outrank it.
 *   - **onStranger** — a label lying on a connection it does not name. It
 *     does not hide a line, it renames it.
 *   - **buryOwn** — a label hiding more than half of its own connection.
 *   - **overLabel** — labels covering each other's words.
 *   - **overBox** — a label covering a box's words.
 *   - **area** — the ground the drawing stands on. Last, because it is a
 *     preference and not a legibility harm: where two arrangements draw the
 *     file equally well, the one on less page is the one to keep.
 *
 * The score is measured with the whole pipeline the reader will see — the
 * routes are what the router will draw and the labels are laid out over the
 * obstacles the canvas will use — and the parts that have nothing to do with
 * arrangement never enter, so a drawing with few connections is not graded
 * easier than one with many. `layoutScore` is pure arithmetic over nodes and
 * edges; arrange the same file twice and it must agree with itself.
