 * because the optional `canvas` package is not installed and is not wanted for
 * this. jsdom answers `null`, which is correct, but shouts "Not implemented:
 * HTMLCanvasElement's getContext()" through the virtual console on the way,
 * once per test file that measures anything. Fourteen lines of that in a green
 * run reads like something is broken.
 *

 * is what jsdom returns anyway, and the fallback engages exactly as it does in
