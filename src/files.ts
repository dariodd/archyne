 * Three backends, picked in order of fidelity:
 *
 * 1. **Desktop** — the Electron preload bridge, which knows the real path of
 *    a file opened by double-click and can write straight back to it.
 * 2. **File System Access API** — Chromium browsers, where Save writes back
 *    to the file the user opened rather than dropping a new copy in
 *    Downloads.
 * 3. **Download + `<input type=file>`** — everywhere else. Open reads a copy
 *    and Save produces a new download; there is no round-trip.
 *
 * Before this, every surface used backend 3: `Save .mmd` always wrote a fresh
 * `diagram.mmd` to Downloads, so open-edit-save never returned to the
 * original file.
