/**
 * The resize handles, and the store plumbing behind them.
 *
 * Shared because every box-shaped node wants the same three things, and
 * because the split between the live half of the drag (`setNodeSize`) and
 * the commit (`onNodeDragStop`) is easy to get subtly wrong per node type.
 *
 * Not every node gets one. A junction is a dot, a fork bar is a bar, and a
 * sequence participant's geometry belongs to the overlay — resizing those
 * would mean something different, or nothing at all.
 *
 * ## Where the handles stop
 *
 * At the size where this node's own content still fits, not at a flat
 * `NODE_MIN`: dragged to 48×28 a node with an icon and a name had nowhere to
 * put either and simply cut them off. Nothing but the rendered element knows
 * how long this label is or how big its icon draws, so the floor is measured
 * from the DOM as the gesture starts.
 *
 * The two directions are held differently, because only one of them has a
 * floor of its own. The narrowest the content goes is a fixed number, so
 * width gets a hard stop and React Flow enforces it. Height has no such
 * number — how tall the content needs to be depends on how wide the box is,
 * and a label needing four lines at 54px needs one at 250 — so a height stop
 * would have to move during the drag, and moving it is not safe here:
 * `getDimensionsAfterResize` picks which way to apply a clamp from the sign
 * of the vertical travel, and on a horizontal-only drag that travel is zero,
 * so a `minHeight` that rises mid-gesture is subtracted rather than added and
 * the node comes out with a negative height.
 *
 * So height is settled on release instead: drag the box as flat as you like,
 * and if the content will not fit in it, it takes back the height it needs.
 * A snap at the end of the gesture rather than a wall during it — which also
 * leaves a wide flat box reachable, since at that width it fits.
