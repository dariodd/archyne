/**
 * The ordinary edge, plus the corners a user can put in it.
 *
 * With no corners this is exactly React Flow's smooth-step edge, down to the
 * label position — which is the point. Being the normal edge type is what
 * makes the *first* corner reachable: the handles have to already be there
 * before there is anything to route through.
 *
 * There are two kinds of handle, and they appear only on a selected edge: a
 * filled one on each corner, which moves it or (double-clicked) removes it,
 * and a hollow one in the middle of each segment, which drags a new corner
 * out of the line. The line itself is draggable too, anywhere along it: in
 * draw.io and Visio you bend an edge by pulling on it, not by finding the dot
 * drawn halfway along, and having to aim for the dot was most of what made
 * this feel stiff next to them.
 *
 * A dragged corner follows the pointer. It briefly obeyed the node grid too,
 * for the sake of one canvas with one set of physics, and that was wrong: a
 * node occupies a cell, a corner is a place you are pointing at, and a corner
 * you cannot put *there* is a corner fighting you. What is left is a small
 * magnet towards the nodes and towards the two route points either side —
 * enough to square a bend off, since a corner sharing its x with the point
 * before it *is* a vertical segment — and Alt to switch even that off.
 *
 * Dragging is not the only way in — the inspector lists the same corners as
 * numbers, and can add and remove them (WCAG 2.5.7).
