/**
 * How big a node actually is, worked out rather than assumed.
 *
 * `estimateSize` in `model/types.ts` answers the same question with constants —
 * 150×46 for a state, a flat 210 for a class however many members it lists — and
 * for the editor that has always been enough: React Flow measures the real
 * element a frame later, every caller prefers `measured` when there is one, and
 * the constant only has to be a plausible starting point for the frame before.
 *
 * A renderer gets no second frame. Outside the editor nothing measures anything
 * afterwards, so the number handed to ELK is the number that ends up in the
 * picture. That is the gap this closes.
 *
 * ## What it returns
 *
 * The size the browser would compute for a node nobody has given a size to —
 * which is not one rule but two, and the difference matters.
 *
 * Most families are shrink-to-fit boxes with a `min-width` floor: a state, a
 * table, a C4 element and a note all grow around what is written in them, so
 * they are measured. A **flowchart shape does not** — `ShapeNode` gives the
 * element the shape's default size and lets a long label wrap and clip inside
 * it, on the principle that a diagram is a set of boxes whose sizes are the
 * author's. Assuming otherwise here over-predicted a long node by 100px.
 *
 * Callers that already have a width pass it, and get the height that width
 * implies.
 *
 * ## Its relationship with the stylesheet
 *
 * The numbers are **not** restated here. `render/boxModel.ts` takes them from
 * `render/boxModel.generated.ts`, which `scripts/build-box-model.mjs` extracts
 * out of `src/styles.css` and CI re-checks — so editing a padding in the
 * stylesheet either updates the measurement or fails the build. They used to be
 * mirrored by hand, and a hand-mirrored constant is wrong the moment somebody
 * edits the original, silently, until a diagram looks off.
 *
 * What that cannot check is whether the arithmetic *around* those numbers is
 * right. `tests/e2e-measure.mts` does: it drives a diagram of every family
 * through the real app and compares what this predicts against what React Flow
 * measured, within 4px.
 *
 * Treat a disagreement as this file being wrong. Every one so far has been:
 * shapes growing when they do not, an ER row missing the gap of an empty span
 * that is always rendered, a code-face row assumed to have the text face's line
 * height, an actor's stick figure uncounted, and three pseudo-state constants
 * that had never matched the stylesheet at all.

 * break-word`, `.shape-node.sized .shape-label { overflow: hidden }`). The

 * the author's, and a node that silently widened because of what was typed in
 * it is not a size anybody chose.
 *
