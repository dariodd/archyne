/**
 * Where each connection's label goes, once they can all see each other.
 *
 * A label wants the middle of its route, and for a diagram with a few
 * connections that is the end of it. Import a real drawing and it is not: the
 * middle of one route is the middle of a box, or the middle of the route
 * beside it, and the plate the label is drawn on then hides a node's text, or
 * another label, or both. Nothing is wrong with any single placement — as with
 * `spread.ts`, the fault only exists between them, so as there, it can only be
 * fixed knowing every one of them at once.
 *
 * The label is moved *along its own route* first. That is the one direction
 * that costs nothing to read: wherever it ends up it is still sitting on the
 * line it names, so it never becomes unclear which connection it belongs to.
 * Only when nowhere along the route will do does it step off to the side,
 * which is a last resort because a floating label has to be traced back to
 * its line.
 *
 * There are two more things it has to keep off, and both are lines rather
 * than boxes. Its **own** connection, because the plate is opaque, so a label
 * lying along a short route covers the whole of it and the connection
 * disappears — which is what an imported drawing is full of, since two boxes
 * a hand's width apart with a long name between them is how people draw. And
 * **everybody else's**, because a label resting on a line reads as that
 * line's name: a label moved clear of its own connection and onto its
 * neighbour has not been made more readable, it has been made wrong.
 *
 * A crowded diagram has labels with nowhere clean to go at all, so this does
 * not insist: `Cost` ranks the five ways a placement can be wrong and the
 * least bad wins when there is no perfect one. Ranked rather than added up,
 * because there is no honest exchange rate between hiding someone else's
 * words and pointing at the wrong line.
 *
 * A label the user has dragged is never moved. It is where it was put, and it
 * takes part only as something for the others to avoid.

/**
 * What is wrong with a placement, in the order it matters.
 *
 * Five separate harms, and they are not worth trading off against each other
 * with weights nobody could defend, so they are compared in order and a
 * placement is better than another only if it is better at the first thing
 * they differ on:
 *
 *   - **`onHead`** — over an arrowhead. First because it is the worst and the
 *     easiest to avoid: a head is a small target, so there is nearly always
 *     somewhere else to stand, and a covered one takes with it the one thing
 *     the line was drawn to say, which of the two boxes it points at. Any
 *     connection's head, not just this label's own: the reader is tracing a
 *     line, and does not care whose label is sitting on the end of it.
 *   - **`onStranger`** — lying *along* a connection that is not the one it
 *     names. Second because it does not merely hide something, it says
 *     something false: a label resting on a line reads as that line's name, so
 *     moving one clear of its own connection and onto its neighbour has not
 *     made the drawing more readable, it has made it wrong.
 *
 *     Along, not across — but only while the label is still touching the line
 *     it names. A plate sitting on its own connection can be crossed by
 *     anything: the reader can see what it belongs to, and a line passing
 *     behind it reads as a line passing behind a label. A plate that has had
 *     to step away from its own connection has no such protection, and the
 *     nearest line it touches will be read as its own — so once it is off its
 *     own line it must be clear of every other one too, crossings included.
 *     `lyingAlong` is what tells the two apart.
 *   - **`onNode`** — over a box, hiding someone else's words.
 *   - **`onLabel`** — over another label, hiding its words.
 *   - **`hidden`** — lying along its own connection, hiding the line. Near
 *     the bottom because a label is *meant* to interrupt the line it names; it
 *     only counts once the plate covers most of the connection, and it is
 *     measured against the route rather than guessed at from its length — a
 *     route that turns twice has its middle on a corner, where the plate lies
 *     across the line rather than along it, and no arithmetic on the total
 *     says so.
 *   - **`crossed`** — how many other connections pass behind the plate. Last,
 *     and only a count, because being crossed is the mildest of these: the
 *     label is still on its own line and the crossing line comes out the other
 *     side, so nothing is misread. But a crossing is still a break in
 *     somebody's line, and where two placements are otherwise equally good the
 *     one interrupting fewer of them is better. It settles ties rather than
 *     driving the search, which matters: widening the lanes the router fans
 *     coincident runs into barely touches this number — the crossings are
 *     mostly connections genuinely travelling across each other, which no
 *     amount of spacing separates — so the only thing that helps is the label
 *     stepping aside, and only when there is somewhere to step.

 * avoiding them would leave nowhere for a label to go; what a label must stay
 * off is the boxes that carry text of their own.
