/**
 * Does `measureNode` predict what the browser actually does?
 *
 * Everything else in the renderer plan rests on this one claim. Parsing is
 * Mermaid's and already runs headless; layout is ELK's and already runs
 * headless; but the size of a node is computed by a browser laying out CSS, and
 * `src/measureNode.ts` has to arrive at the same number without one. The
 * constants it works from are copied out of `src/styles.css` by hand, and a
 * copied constant is wrong the moment somebody edits the original.
 *
 * So both answers are asked for in the one place where both exist. The page
 * reports, per node, what `measureNode` predicted and what React Flow measured
 * after the browser laid it out; this compares them.
 *
 * Nodes that carry a size of their own are skipped: their box is whatever was
 * typed, so agreeing about it proves nothing. Groups are skipped for the same
 * reason — layout sizes them from their children.
 *
 * A sequence participant is compared on width only. Its element is a head *and
 * a lifeline*, and the lifeline's length is a property of the diagram — how
 * many messages it has to reach past — rather than of the node. `measureNode`
 * answers for the head, which is the part layout places; asking it to predict
 * the lifeline would be asking it to predict the message list.
 *
 * Run:  npm run dev, then npx tsx tests/e2e-measure.mts

/**
 * How far apart the two may be before it counts as a disagreement.
 *
 * Not zero, and it should not be: `line-height: normal` resolves through the
 * font's own metrics, the browser lays out at sub-pixel precision and reports
 * rounded, and a stack that falls back to a different face on a different
 * machine measures differently. What the tolerance is for is the difference
 * between *that* and a constant somebody changed in one file and not the other.
