/**
 * The rendered SVG, opened as a document nobody helped it become.
 *
 * Every other test here drives the *app*. This one deliberately does not: it
 * builds the string in Node, with no browser anywhere near it, writes it to a
 * file, and asks a browser to open that file cold. No dev server, no React, no
 * stylesheet, no `?code=` — nothing but the string.
 *
 * That is the entire claim behind `RENDERER.local.md`. Archyne can already be
 * *embedded*; what it could not do until now is hand somebody a picture that
 * survives the page that made it. If this passes, it can.
 *
 * Run:  npx tsx tests/e2e-render.mts   (no server needed — that is the point)

 * used to disappear, leaving boxes with no words in them, in exactly the place

 * is the one route that needs nobody's cooperation, and `<img>` is how those
 * files get shown. GitHub, resvg, librsvg and most PDF pipelines have the same
