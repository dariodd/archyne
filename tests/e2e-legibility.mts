/**
 * E2E: can you actually read the drawing?
 *
 * The router and the label placer are covered as arithmetic by their own unit
 * tests — `spread.test.ts`, `berths.test.ts`, `labels.test.ts` — and those
 * check the rules on cases written to exercise them. What they cannot check is
 * the thing the rules exist for: that on a real diagram, laid out by somebody
 * else, nothing important ends up hidden underneath something else.
 *
 * So this measures the finished picture, over every diagram this repository
 * ships, and fails on six things a reader would notice:
 *
 *   - **a connection drawn on top of another one.** Worst when the two are
 *     drawn differently — a dashed line under a solid one does not read as a
 *     crowded corridor, it reads as a connection that is not there.
 *   - **a connection drawn along a group's border**, which is the same fault
 *     against a line that is not a connection: it disappears into the frame.
 *   - **an arrowhead on a bend.** A connection meets a box square on, and the
 *     straight run before the head is what says which face it arrived at; a
 *     head on the rounded part of a corner reads as arriving sideways.
 *     Reported rather than failed, for now — see `noted` below.
 *   - **an arrowhead under a label.** A covered head takes with it the one
 *     thing the line was drawn to say: which of the two boxes it points at.
 *   - **a label sitting on a connection it does not name.** A label resting on
 *     a line reads as that line's name, so this does not hide anything — it
 *     says something false, and points the reader at the wrong arrow.
 *   - **a label over a box**, hiding the box's own words.
 *   - **a label over another label.**
 *   - **a box drawn outside the group it belongs to**, or two unrelated groups
 *     overlapping. Checked twice over: as the diagram arrives, and again after
 *     Auto-layout has rearranged it, because a container's size lives in three
 *     places and a rearrangement that updates only one of them draws every
 *     frame at its old size in its new place.
 *
 * Everything is measured in *diagram* units rather than screen pixels, so the
 * thresholds mean the same thing whatever the window size or the zoom.
 *
 * Run:  npm run dev, then npx tsx tests/e2e-legibility.mts
