 * Archyne as an editor for `.mmd` files.
 *
 * A `CustomTextEditorProvider` rather than a `CustomEditorProvider`, because
 * a Mermaid file *is* text and VS Code should keep owning it: the dirty dot,
 * undo, save, the diff against HEAD and everything git-shaped come from the
 * `TextDocument`, and this only has to draw it and hand edits back. Nothing
 * here touches the disk.
 *
 * Registered at `priority: "option"`, so opening a `.mmd` still gives the
 * text editor — the canvas is a way to look at the file, not a replacement
 * for reading it.
