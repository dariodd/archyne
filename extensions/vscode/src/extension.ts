/**
 * The extension is a shell around the editor that already exists: it hands a
 * VS Code `TextDocument` to the same bundle the web app and the desktop app
 * run, and hands the edits back. What it adds is where it runs — beside the
 * file, in the tool the diagram is already committed from.
 *
 * Two ways in, because Mermaid lives in two places. A `.mmd` file gets the
 * custom editor, which owns the whole document. A fenced block in Markdown
 * gets a CodeLens and a panel bound to the block's range — which is where most
 * Mermaid in a repository actually is: a README, an ADR, a page under `docs/`.
